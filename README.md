I'm a frontend developer located in Mexico and this is my portfolio. It showcases the projects I have worked on and tells people who I am. I developed it with nothing but good HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Projects

All projects have a title, description, a list of technologies I used to build them and links to **live demos** and **GitHub repos**.
